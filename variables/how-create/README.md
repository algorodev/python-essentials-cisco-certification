## How to create a variable

**A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it**. Unlike in other languages, you don't need to declare it in any special way.

The creation (in other words, its syntax) is extremely simple: **just use the name of the desired variable, then the equal sign (=) and the value you want to put into the variable.**

```
var = 1
```

It consists of two simple instructions:

- The first of them creates a variable named ```var```, and assigns a literal with an integer value equal to ```1```.
- The second prints the value of the newly created variable to the console.
