## The input() function with an argument

The ```input()``` function can do something else: it can prompt the user without any help from ```print()```.

Note:

- the ```input()``` function is invoked with one argument â€’ it's a string containing a message;
- the message will be displayed on the console before the user is given an opportunity to enter anything;
- ```input()``` will then do its job.
- 
This variant of the ```input()``` invocation simplifies the code and makes it clearer.
