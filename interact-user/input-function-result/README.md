## The result of the input() function

We've said it already, but it must be unambiguously stated once again: **the result of the** ```input()``` **function is a string**.

A string containing all the characters the user enters from the keyboard. It is not an integer or a float.

This means that **you mustn't use it as an argument of any arithmetic operation**, e.g., you can't use this data to square it, divide it by anything, or divide anything by it.
