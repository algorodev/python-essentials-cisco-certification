## Comparison: equality operator

Question: **are two values equal**?

To ask this question, you use the ```==``` (equal equal) operator.

Don't forget this important distinction:

- ```=``` is an assignment operator, e.g., ```a = b ```assigns ```a``` with the value of ```b```;
- ```==``` is the question are these values equal? so ```a == b``` compares ```a``` and ```b```.
- 
It is a **binary operator with left-sided binding**. It needs two arguments and **checks if they are equal**.
