## Strings

Strings are used when you need to process text (like names of all kinds, addresses, novels, etc.), not numbers.

You already know a bit about them, e.g., that **strings need quotes** the way floats need points.

This is a very typical string: ```"I am a string."```

The backslash can escape quotes too. A quote preceded by a backslash changes its meaning ‒ it's not a delimiter, but just a quote.

Python can use **an apostrophe instead of a quote**. Either of these characters may delimit strings, but you must be **consistent**.

**A string can be empty** ‒ it may contain no characters at all.

''
""
```
